Step 3: Interpret Results

Example

· If Raw Material A has r = -0.80 with CST, → it strongly reduces compressive strength when its % increases.

· If Raw Material B has r = +0.65 with CST, → it strongly increases compressive strength when its % increases.

· If Raw Material C has r = -0.10 with IST, → it has little effect on Initial Setting Time.
