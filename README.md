Step 3: Interpret Results

Example

· If Raw Material A has r = -0.80 with CST, → it strongly reduces compressive strength when its % increases.

· If Raw Material B has r = +0.65 with CST, → it strongly increases compressive strength when its % increases.

· If Raw Material C has r = -0.10 with IST, → it has little effect on Initial Setting Time.


strong: |r| ≥ 0.70
moderate: 0.30 ≤ |r| < 0.70
weak: |r| < 0.30
------------------------------------------------------------------
increases: r > 0 → as the input goes up, the output tends to go up.
reduces: r < 0 → as the input goes up, the output tends to go down.
Near zero → r ≈ 0: little to no linear relationship.
